I used this repo as a small demo for students who attended my presentations.

## Potential gotchas

This demo is not a production ready application. To make it more secure and closer to production - API private key should be properly loaded from a secret storage (AWS Secrets Manager / HashiCorp Vault). During my demo all private keys were revoked after demo.
